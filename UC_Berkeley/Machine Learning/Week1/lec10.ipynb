Take a moment to think about what someone might be able to infer from this kind of data.\n \nAs we've seen here, it's not too hard to make a pretty good guess at roughly where some lives, from this kind of information: their car is probably parked near their home most nights.  Also, it will often be possible to guess where someone works: if they commute into work by car, then on weekdays during business hours, their car is probably parked near their office, so we'll see a clear cluster that indicates where they work.\n\nBut it doesn't stop there.  If we have enough data, it might also be possible to get a sense of what they like to do during their downtime (do they spend time at the park?).  And in some cases the data might reveal that someone is in a relationship and spending nights at someone else's house.  That's arguably pretty sensitive stuff.\n\nThis gets at one of the challenges with privacy.  Data that's collected for one purpose (fighting crime, or something like that) can potentially reveal a lot more.

That's a lengthy subject.  But at risk of over-simplifying, there are a few simple strategies that data owners can take:\n\n1. Minimize the data they have.  Collect only what they need, and delete it after it's not needed.\n\n2. Control who has access to the sensitive data.  Perhaps only a handful of trusted insiders need access; if so, then one can lock down the data so only they have access to it.  One can also log all access, to deter misuse.\n\n3. Anonymize the data, so it can't be linked back to the individual who it is about.  Unfortunately, this is often harder than it sounds.\n\n4. Engage with stakeholders.  Provide transparency, to try to avoid people being taken by surprise.  Give individuals a way to see what data has been collected about them.  Give people a way to opt out and have their data be deleted, if they wish.  Engage in a discussion about values, and tell people what steps you are taking to protect them from unwanted consequences.\n\nThis only scratches the surface of the subject.
