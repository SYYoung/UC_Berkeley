Lab 5 is part 2 of the investigation.\n\nYou will build a classifier that guesses whether a song is hip-hop or country, using only the number of times that each word appears in a song's lyrics.  By the end of the project, you should know how to:\n\n1. Clean and organize a dataset used to test a machine learning model\n2. Build a k-nearest neighbors classifier\n3. Test a classifier on data\n\n**Advice.** Develop your answers incrementally. To perform a complicated table manipulation, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect.

Please do this first before running the cell below,\n- **run all the tests and verify that they all pass** (the next cell has a shortcut for that), \n- **Review the notebook one last time** If you make any changes, please **Save and Checkpoint** again.\n- **Hit the Submit button** Your submission will be saved and grade will be posted when it's finished running."},{"metadata":{"scrolled":false,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# For your convenience, you can run this cell to run all the tests at once!\nimport glob\nfrom gofer.ok import check_all\ndisplay(check_all(glob.glob('tests/q*.py')))","execution_count":31,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":"Question 1:\n","name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<gofer.ok.OKTestsResult at 0x7f0891321790>","text/html":"\n    \n    \n        <p>All tests passed!</p>\n    \n    "},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","text":"Question 2:\n","name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<gofer.ok.OKTestsResult at 0x7f089129fdd0>","text/html":"\n    \n    \n        <p>All tests passed!</p>\n    \n    "},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","text":"Question 3:\n","name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<gofer.ok.OKTestsResult at 0x7f08912bc1d0>","text/html":"\n    \n    \n        <p>All tests passed!</p>\n    \n    "},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","text":"Question 4:\n","name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<gofer.ok.OKTestsResult at 0x7f0891fe7390>","text/html":"\n    \n    \n        <p>All tests passed!</p>\n    \n    "},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","text":"Question 5:\n","name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<gofer.ok.OKTestsResult at 0x7f08912ad7d0>","text/html":"\n    \n    \n        <p>All tests passed!</p>\n    \n    "},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","text":"Question 6:\n","name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<gofer.ok.OKTestsResult at 0x7f08912ad5d0>","text/html":"\n    \n    \n        <p>All tests passed!</p>\n    \n    "},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","text":"Question 7:\n","name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<gofer.ok.OKTestsResult at 0x7f0891501c50>","text/html":"\n    \n    \n        <p>All tests passed!</p>\n    \n    "},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","text":"Question 8:\n","name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<gofer.ok.OKTestsResult at 0x7f08912ae1d0>","text/html":"\n    \n    \n        <p>All tests passed!</p>\n    \n    "},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","text":"Question 9:\n","name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<gofer.ok.OKTestsResult at 0x7f08912ae490>","text/html":"\n    \n    \n        <p>All tests passed!</p>\n    \n    "},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"1.0"},"metadata":{}}]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"anaconda-cloud":{},"course":"8x","kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"lab":"lab05","language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.7.8","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"section":"3"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
